summary: 'This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic
  model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model.
  TopoFlow supports three different types of flow diversions: sources, sinks
  and canals. Sources are locations such as natural springs where water
  enters the watershed at a point by some process other than those that
  are otherwise modeled. Similarly, sinks are locations where water leaves
  the watershed at a point. Canals are generally man-made reaches such as
  tunnels or irrigation ditches that transport water from one point to another,
  typically without following the natural gradient of the terrain that is
  indicated by the DEM. The upstream end is essentially a sink and the downstream
  end a source.'
