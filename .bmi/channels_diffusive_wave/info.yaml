summary: This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic
  model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model.
  It uses the 'diffusive wave' method to compute flow velocities for all
  of the channels in a D8-based river network. This wave method is similar
  to the kinematic wave method for modeling flow in open channels, but instead
  of a simple balance between friction and gravity, this method includes
  the pressure gradient that is induced by a water-depth gradient in the
  downstream direction. This means that instead of using bed slope in Manning's
  equation or the law of the wall, the water-surface slope is used. One
  consequence of this is that water is able to move across flat areas that
  have a bed slope of zero. Local and convective accelerations in the momentum
  equations are still neglected, just as is done in the kinematic wave method.
