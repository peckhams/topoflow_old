summary: GC2D is a two-dimensional finite difference numerical model that
  is driven by a calculations of glacier mass balance (snow precipitation
  - melt rate). The model calculates ice surface elevations above a two-dimensional
  terrain by solving equations for ice flux and mass conservation using
  explicit methods.
