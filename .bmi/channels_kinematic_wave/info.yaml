summary: This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic
  model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model.
  The kinematic wave method (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955) is the simplest
  method for modeling flow in open channels. This method combines mass conservation
  with the simplest possible treatment of momentum conservation, namely
  that all terms in the general momentum equation (pressure gradient, local
  acceleration and convective acceleration) are neglible except the friction
  and gravity terms. A flow in which gravitational acceleration is exactly
  balanced by friction is referred to as steady, uniform flow. For these
  flows the water surface slope, energy slope and bed slope are all equal.
