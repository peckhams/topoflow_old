summary: This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic
  model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model.
  The dynamic wave method is the most complete and complex method for modeling
  flow in open channels. This method retains all of the terms in the full,
  1D momentum equation, including the gravity, friction and pressure gradient
  terms (as used by the diffusive wave method) as well as local and convective
  acceleration (or momentum flux) terms. This full equation is known as
  the St. Venant equation. In the current version of TopoFlow it is assumed
  that the flow directions are static and given by a D8 flow grid. In this
  case, integral vs. differential forms of the conservation equations for
  mass and momentum can be used.
